<h2 align="center">Training a Robot to Navigate a Hospital with Deep Learning</h2>

In this project, a simulated robot is trained to navigate a hospital and deliver medicine to patients. Traditional artificial intelligence models require a lot of triaining data to effectively teach the agent, but machine learning requires none. All of the training data is gathered by the agent itself through exploration.
